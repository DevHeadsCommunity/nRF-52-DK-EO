# Default Example Project

The default example project is designed to contain the minimum amount of code to get you up and running. It consists of two files:

`conftest.py` - This file implements a fixture which flashes the target once, at the beginning of the test session
`test_default.py` - This file contains a blank passing test. It can be renamed or have tests added to it.
