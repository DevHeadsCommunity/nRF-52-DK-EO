# SCP Example Project

This example showcases the transferring of a file to a remote server by using the SCP and SSH exec wrapper.

It consists of two files:

`conftest.py` - Implements a fixture that returns a `RemoteInterface()` interface.

`test_scp.py` - Contains a test that sends a file to a remote server by using the SCP wrapper.
